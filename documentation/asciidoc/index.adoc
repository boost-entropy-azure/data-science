== Introduction

Welcome!
The Data Science Pipeline project is an open source project with a goal of facilitating the analysis of sensor data. At its
core, the Data Science Pipeline is a generic streaming platform which can be built upon. It was designed to be abstracted
away from specific data and sensors so that any device can feed data into the pipeline and specific analysis jobs can be
written to extract meaningful information.
