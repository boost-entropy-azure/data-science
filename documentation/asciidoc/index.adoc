== Introduction

Welcome!
The Data Science Platform is an open source project with a goal of facilitating the analysis of sensor data. At its
core, the Data Science Platform is a generic streaming platform which can be built upon. It was designed to be agnostic
of specific data and sensor types so that any device may feed data into the pipeline and specific analysis jobs may be
written to extract meaningful information.
